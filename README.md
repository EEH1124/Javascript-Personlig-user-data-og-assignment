This is a small school project where I made a simple book dashboard using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

What the app does

- You can add books with title, author, genre, and pages
- The books show up in a list below the form
- You can delete single books or all of them
- It saves everything in localStorage so it is still there when you refresh
- It also shows total pages from all the books

Tools I used

- HTML to build the page
- CSS for basic styling (I used color names to keep it simple)
- JavaScript for logic (I used map(), filter(), reduce(), and localStorage)

Notes

- I added comments in the code to explain everything
- I tried to keep it clean and easy to understand
- This was my first time making
